# arithmetic_formatter
An arithmetic formatter built in Python as part of the freeCodeCamp Scientific Computing with Python course.

The aim was to reformat a list of arithmetic problems so that they appeared side by side and vertically as though they were being solved by students in school.
I also had to include return statements for various errors eg non-numerical values given, too many problems given or the wrong operators used.
